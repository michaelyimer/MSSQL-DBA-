DATABASE ARCHITECTURE:													
	DATABASE IS PHYSICALLY A COLLECTION OF "FILES". FOR EASY STORAGE, MANAGEMENT AND DATA RECOVERY.
	
	TYPES OF FILES:
		1. ROWS DATA FILES -	USED TO STORE DATA FROM TABLES.  MEANS, DATA FILE CONTAIN TABLES. 
			1. PRIMARY DATA FILE	:	TO STORE METADATA [DB PROPERTIES] OF DATABASE + TABLE DATA. (.mdf). THIS IS MANDATORY.
			2. SECONDARY DATA FILE 	:	TO STORE TABLE DATA (.ndf). THESE FILES ARE OPTIONAL. USED FOR VERY BIG TABLES. 
			
		2. LOG FILES		-	USED TO STORE AUDIT OR MONITORING INFORMATION = TLOG FILE  = TRANSACTION LOG FILE (.ldf)
		3. FILESTREAM FILES - 	USED TO STORE BIG DATA OR HUGE DATA FROM VARIOUS FILES. EX: DOC, PDF, EXCEL, IMAGES, ETC...

>>>	DATA FILES ARCHITECTURE:	
		EACH DATA FILE IS DIVIDED INTO "PAGES". SIZE OF EACH PAGE = 8 KB.
		A COLLECTION OF 8 CONSECUTIVE PAGES IS CALLED AN "EXTENT". 
		
		TYPES OF EXTENTS:
			1. UNIFORM EXTENT 	: ALL 8 PAGES IN THE EXTENT STORE DATA FOR A SINGLE TABLE
			2. MIXED EXTENT 	: EVERY PAGE IN THE EXTENT STORE DATA FOR DIFFERENT TABLES

>>>	LOG FILES ARCHITECTURE
		EACH LOG FILE IS DIVIDED INTO "PAGES". SIZE OF EACH PAGE = 8 KB.A COLLECTION OF FEW PAGES IS CALLED AN "VIRTUAL LOG FILE".
		EVERY OPERATION WE PERFORM ON THE DATABASE IS AUTO ASSIGNED WITH A UNIQUE "LSN" = LSN = LOG SEQUENCE NUMBER.
		START LOCATION (ADDRESS) OF EVERY "VIRTUAL LOG FILE" [VLF] IS CALLED "MINI LSN". 
		"CHECKPOINT" IS A PROCESS TO WRITE DATA FROM LOG FILE TO DATA FILE. 
		"WAL = WRITE AHEAD LOG" IS A MECHANISM TO AUDIT OR MONITOR EVERY OPERATION TO LOG FILE FIRST. THEN TO DATA FILE, IF NEEDED. 

FILEGROUPS : MULTIPLE DATA FILES FORM ONE "FILEGROUP". THIS FILEGROUP IS USED TO PLACE TABLES TO SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. 
BY DEFAULT, ONE FILEGROUP CALLED "PRIMARY FILEGROUP" IS AUTO CREATED WITH EVERY DATABASE.
