TUNING TOOLS
	ONCE WE IMPLEMENT INDEXES, INDEXED VIEWS, JOIN OPTIONS, SP RECOMPILATIONS, PARTITIONS, PARTIONED VIEWS, 
	IN-MEMORY TABLES AND ALSO ENSURE TO ADDRESS FRAGMENTATION ISSUES AND STATISTICS UPDATES
	USING MAINTENANCE PLANS THEN : 

	FINALLY, WE NEED TO USE TUNING TOOLS AND VERIFY THE POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH QUERIES, TABLES & DATABASE.
	THESE TUNING TOOLS GIVES US THE RECOMMENDATIONS. DERIVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND IMPLEMENT THEM AGAINST THE DATABASE.

		1. SQL PROFILER	TOOL
		2. DATABASE ENGINE TUNING ADVISOR (DTA) TOOL 
	
	
1.	SQL PROFILER TOOL IS USED TO AUDIT THE EVENTS PERTAINING TO QUERY EXECUTIONS.
	THE EVENTS BEING AUDITTED DEPENDS ON THE TEMPLATE WE SELECT. 
	EX: "TUNING TEMPLATE" RESULTS IN THREE EVENTS :
			i.	SP : COMPLETED EVENT
			ii.	RPC: COMPLETED EVENT
			iii.	T-SQL BATCH COMPLETED EVENT

	STEP 1: LAUNCH SSMS >> CONNECT TO SERVER >>  INSTALL THE SOURCE DATABASE BY EXECUTING THE GIVEN SET OF FOUR .SQL FILES
	STEP 2: FROM SSMS TOOL > GO TO TOP : TOOLS >> SQL SERVER PROFILER  >> SPECIFY SERVER NAME >
		CONNECT >> GIVE A NAME TO THE TRACE  (TRC = AUDIT) >> SELECT REQUIRED TEMPLATE (EX: TUNING TEMPLATE)
		SPECIFY THE LOCATION TO SAVE THE OUTPUT / TRACE FILE >> ENABLE ROLLOVER AND SERVER PROCESS TRACE DATA. 
		RUN THE PROFILER.

	STEP 3: EXECUTE THE QUERIES FROM THE GIVEN .SQL FILE
	STEP 4: STOP THE PROFILER. THIS RESULTS IN A TRACE FILE. 


2. 	DATABASE ENGINE TUNING ADVISOR (DTA) TOOL IS USED ANALYSE / UNDERSTAND .SQL QUERIES AND .TRC AUDIT REPORTS
	THIS TOOL GIVES US RECOMMENDATIONS ON POSSIBLE DATABASE OBJECTS TO BE CREATED FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE QUERIES. 
	THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE:
			i. 	INDEX CREATION  	/ INDEX ALTER
			ii. 	STATISTICS CREATION 	/ STATISTICS UPDATE
			iii. 	PARTITIONS CREATION  	/ PARTITIONS ALTER

	STEP 5: FROM SSMS TOOL > GO TO TOP : TOOLS >> DATABASE ENGINE TUNING ADVISOR >> SPECIFY SERVER NAME > 
		INPUT = TRACE FILE FROM PROFILER TOOL ABVOE. SELECT INPUT DATABASE AND WORKLOAD DATABASE
		START ANALYSIS.. THIS GIVES "RECOMMENDATIONS".
		SELECT EACH RECOMMENDATION MANUALLY >> GENERATE SCRIPT (LAST COLUMN IN RECOMMENDATION TABLE)
		RUN THE SCRIPT ON THE DATABASE.
OR
		RIGHT CLICK QUERY IN SSMS >> ANALYSE QUERY IN DB ENINE TUNING ADVISOR TOOL.	 THIS GIVES "RECOMMENDATIONS" > RUN SCRIPTS
