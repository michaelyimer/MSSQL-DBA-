	"EXECUTION PLAN" IS USED BY "QUERY OPTIMIZER" COMPONENT TO ENSURE THE BEST USAGE OF RESOURCES (MEMORY & CPU) 

	TYPES OF EXECUTION PLANS STATISTICS  (QUERY STATISTICS) :
		1. ESTIMATED EXECUTION PLAN		: PLAN FOR QUERY EXECUTION; GENERATED BEFORE THE QUERY EXECUTION
		2. ACTUAL EXECUTION PLAN		: PLAN FOR QUERY EXECUTION; GENERATED AFTER THE QUERY EXECUTION
		3. LIVE EXECUTION PLAN  		: PLAN FOR QUERY EXECUTION; GENERATED DURING THE QUERY EXECUTION
							  NEW FROM SSMS 2016 VERSION.
		TO TEST ABOVE QUERY STATISTICS:
		FROM SSMS > RIGHT CLICK QUERY > SELECT REQUIRED EXECUTION PLAN TYPE.

		SPOOLING	: REQUIRED DATA IS LOADED TO TEMPDB FOR FASTER CALCULATIONS, COMPARISONS, LOOPS, AUDITS, ETC..

	QUERY COST TYPES:
		1. IO COST		:	REFERS TO THE DISK IO FOR READS & WRITES ON THE DATABASE FILES.
						FOR HIGHER IO COST, TRACK FOR MISSING INDEXES & IMPLEMENT DTA TOOL.

		2. CPU COST		:	REFERS TO THE THREAD MANAGEMENT FACTOR BASED ON "NUMA" NODES ON YOUR PROCESSOR.
						EACH PROCESSOR HAS TWO CORES IN A SOCKET.
						EX: IF YOU HAVE A CORE 2 DUO PROCESSOR MEANS YOU HAVE FOUR PROCESSOR NODES. 
						ENSURE LESSER CPU COST. 
						FOR HIGHER CPU COST VALUES, BOOST SQL SERVER PRIORITY AND SET PROPER THREAD COUNT.
						
		3. SUB TREE COST	:	REFERS TO THE COST INVOLVED IN ANALYSING THE PARSE TREE AND COMPILE TREE.
						REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SUB QUERIES AND SELF JOINS, IF POSSIBLE. 
						RECOMPILE THE LONG RUNNING STORED PROCEDURES. 
	
		4. OPERATOR COST	:	THIS REFERS TO QUERY PREDICATES, KEYWORDS AND OPERATIONS WITHIN SQL QUERIES.
						EX: MERGE JOIN OPTION IS FASTER COMPARED TO HASH JOIN OPTION.
						FOR HIGHER OPERATOR COST, IT IS ADVISABLE TO ENSURE STATS UPDATES
